This directory contains:

 - A shuttle simulation: 'SpaceShuttlePhysics.py' (in subdirectory 'Physics')

 - A Deep QN Agent 'DQNAgent.py' (in subdirectory 'DeepQ')

 - A test python script to test the shuttle simulation: 'SpaceShuttleTest.py'

 - A suggestion for a Capstone project based on the shuttle simulation: 'SuggestionForCapstoneProject.pdf'

 - A Capstone project based on the shuttle simulation: 'CapstoneProject.pdf'
 
 - A steering file that you can run in a python3 console 'ShuttleEscape.py'
 
 - A steering Notebook 'ShuttleEscape.ipynb' that does essentially the same as 'ShuttleEscape.py' but in a Jupyter environment.
 
 - A test run of the notebook 'ShuttleEscape.ipynb', ShuttleEscape.html (the second run to get rid of the deprecation warnings in Keras)
 
 
 - A read-me file (this one) 

Getting Started
----------------

- If you have all files (and subdirectories) in one directory and python3 installed, you can run 'python SpaceShuttleTest.py' in a console.
  You will see a plot showing the trajectory of the shuttle and its orientation in its simulated world. 

- To start the learning you have to run 'ShuttleEscape.py' in a python 3 console with all the above files and subdirectory available
  You will see plots similar to the ones in 'CapstoneProject.pdf' (hopefully ;-))
  OR
  Open the Jupyter notebook and 'run all cells'

Dependencies:
-------------
- Keras (if you run 'ShuttleEscape.py')
- Anaconda Installation (for Jupyter Notebook, eg. Anaconda Navigator 1.9.2 with Jupyter 5.6.0)
